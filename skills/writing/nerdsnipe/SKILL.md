# Nerdsnipe

Transform any text into irresistibly engaging problems that smart people can't help but solve. Targets specific intellectual taste violations to create magnetic research questions.

## Usage

```
/nerdsnipe [text or file]
/nerdsnipe analyze [url/file]  # Analyze existing nerdsnipe effectiveness
/nerdsnipe quick [problem]     # Quick console-only transformation
```

Or in conversation: "make this more nerdsnipeable" or "nerdsnipe this problem"

## What Makes Something Nerdsnipeable?

### The Core Formula

```
╔══════════════════════════════════════════╗
║  🎯 NERDSNIPE FORMULA                    ║
╠══════════════════════════════════════════╣
║  1. Intellectual Offense → "It's absurd" ║
║  2. Low-Hanging Fruit → "You could be 1st"║
║  3. Difficulty Ladder → A→B→C→D ratings  ║
║  4. Visual Evidence → Partial solutions   ║
║  5. Permission to Fail → "Learning wins" ║
║  6. Concrete First Step → "Start here"   ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

## Invocation

**If the user provided text as an argument:** transform it immediately — skip to Quick Transformation or Full Document Transformation depending on length.

**If invoked with no argument:** show this preview and ask for the text:

```
╔══════════════════════════════════════════╗
║  🧲 NERDSNIPE                            ║
║  Make any problem irresistible           ║
╠══════════════════════════════════════════╣
║  1. Intellectual Offense → "It's absurd" ║
║  2. Low-Hanging Fruit → "You could be 1st"║
║  3. Difficulty Ladder → A→B→C→D ratings  ║
║  4. Visual Evidence → Partial solutions  ║
║  5. Permission to Fail → "Learning wins" ║
║  6. Concrete First Step → "Start here"   ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

Then ask: **"Paste the text you want to nerdsnipe — or describe the problem:"**

## Instructions

### Quick Transformation (Console)

For a quick nerdsnipe, show this visualization:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  🧲 NERDSNIPE ANALYSIS             │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Original Score:  ░░░░░░░░░░ 20%   │
│  Transformed:     ████████░░ 85%   │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│  ✅ Added intellectual offense      │
│  ✅ Marked unsolved problems       │
│  ✅ Added difficulty ratings       │
│  ✅ Created concrete first steps   │
│  ⚡ Ready to hook smart people!    │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Full Document Transformation

1. **Analyze the input** for nerdsnipe potential
2. **Apply transformations**:
   - Add "It offends me that..." framing
   - Tag problems with [No prior work]
   - Add difficulty ratings (A/B/C/D)
   - Include visual evidence/partial solutions
   - Add "You could be first" hooks
   - Create concrete next steps
   - Add community/collaboration hooks

3. **Generate output** with sections:
   - Introduction with intellectual offense
   - Difficulty rating guide
   - Concrete problems with:
     - 🌟 Stars for exciting problems
     - [No prior work] tags
     - Specific first steps
     - Visual evidence
   - Community section
   - "What are you waiting for?" call to action

### Analysis Mode

When analyzing existing text for nerdsnipe effectiveness:

```
╔═══════════════════════════════════════╗
║  📊 NERDSNIPE EFFECTIVENESS          ║
╠═══════════════════════════════════════╣
║  Intellectual Offense:  ██████░░ 75% ║
║  Low-Hanging Fruit:     ████░░░░ 50% ║
║  Concrete Problems:     ████████ 100% ║
║  First Steps Clear:     ██░░░░░░ 25% ║
║  Community Hooks:       ░░░░░░░░ 0%  ║
║  Visual Evidence:       ████░░░░ 50% ║
╠═══════════════════════════════════════╣
║  Overall Score:         █████░░░ 58% ║
║  Recommendation: Add first steps!     ║

## Transformation Patterns

### Pattern 1: The Offense Hook
**Before:** "Multi-agent systems have coordination problems"
**After:** "It offends me that 93% of agents fail at basic cooperation yet we're terrified of collusion"

### Pattern 2: The First-Mover Glory
**Before:** "This problem needs investigation"
**After:** "No one has explained this [No prior work] - you could be first"

### Pattern 3: The Difficulty Ladder
**Before:** "Try solving this"
**After:** "Problem 1 [A - Weekend project]: Can you replicate the finding in 2 hours?"

### Pattern 4: The Visual Mystery
```
Before: "There's a threshold at 0.9%"
After:
Coordination vs Connectivity:
0.0-0.8%: ░░░░░░░░░░ (nothing)
0.9%:     ████████░░ (sudden jump!)
           ↑ What happens here?
```

### Pattern 5: The Permission Structure
**Before:** "Attempt this research"
**After:** "Even if you fail, you'll learn something valuable. Negative results matter!"

## Output Formats

### Document Header
```markdown
# [Number] Concrete Open Problems in [Field]
*[Tagline about low-hanging fruit and being first]*

## Why This Should Offend You
[Intellectual offense paragraph]

**Difficulty Ratings:**
- **A** = Weekend to 2 weeks
- **B** = 2-6 weeks
- **C** = 2-3 months
- **D** = 6+ months

🌟 = Particularly exciting
[No prior work] = You could be first
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Research Problem
**Input:** "Study hallucinations in LLMs"
**Output:** "🌟 Can you distinguish strategic hallucinations from random errors? [B] [No prior work] Start by collecting 1000 hallucinations and looking for cross-model patterns."

### Example 2: Technical Challenge
**Input:** "Improve model cooperation"
**Output:** "The 93% Failure Mystery [A]: No one knows why agents consistently fail. Replicate with Claude+GPT pairs this weekend. You could crack this."

### Example 3: Full Document
Transform entire research agendas, blog posts, or problem lists into nerdsnipe-optimized formats that maximize engagement from smart readers.

## Visual Progression Display

Show transformation progress:
```
Original Text    Transformed Text
░░░░░░░░░░  →   ████████████
Boring          Irresistible!

Changes Applied:
✓ Intellectual offense added
✓ 12 problems tagged [No prior work]
✓ Difficulty ratings A-D
✓ 8 visual mysteries added
✓ Concrete first steps for all
✓ Community hooks included
```

## Integration with Projects

When user is working on a project (e.g., BlueDot course), save transformed documents to:
```
personal/projects/[project-name]/nerdsnipe/
├── transformed_problems.md
├── nerdsnipe_analysis.md
└── visual_hooks.md
```

## Key Phrases That Trigger Nerdsnipe Mode

- "Make this more engaging"
- "How do I get people interested"
- "Nerdsnipe this"
- "Make this irresistible"
- "Hook smart people"
- "Low-hanging fruit"

## Success Metrics

A well-nerdniped document should have:
- At least one "It offends me" or equivalent hook
- 30%+ problems marked [No prior work]
- Clear difficulty ratings
- Concrete first step for every problem
- At least 2-3 visual elements
- Community/collaboration mention
- "What are you waiting for?" energy

## Remember

The goal isn't to make things artificially exciting. It's to reveal the genuine intellectual excitement that already exists in the problem. Smart people want:
1. To be first
2. Clear challenges
3. Tractable mysteries
4. Peer community
5. Permission to explore

Make research feel like the world's best puzzle game.
