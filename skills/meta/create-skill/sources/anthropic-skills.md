# Anthropic Skills to Consider When Creating a New Skill

**Source:** [https://github.com/anthropics/skills](https://github.com/anthropics/skills)

Before writing a new skill from scratch, check whether an existing skill in Anthropic's repo already covers the need—or can be extended. Install via Claude Code: `/plugin marketplace add anthropics/skills`, then install `document-skills` or `example-skills`.

## When to Use This Reference

- **Creating a new skill** — Scan the categories below; if one matches your use case, read that skill's SKILL.md in the repo first.
- **Extending document/file handling** — Prefer building on docx/pdf/pptx/xlsx if your task is creating or editing those formats.
- **MCP or tooling** — Check mcp-builder and web-artifacts-builder for patterns.
- **Design or comms** — Check brand-guidelines, frontend-design, internal-comms for structure and tone.
